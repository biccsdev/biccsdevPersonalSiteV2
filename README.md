# Personal Portfolio V2

## Description

The second version of my portfolio was developed with a focus on utilizing new technologies. While the initial version of my site was created using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I chose to employ the React Framework and Tailwind for this updated iteration. These tools allowed me to construct more intricate websites through effective state management and component utilization, ultimately improving the scalability of my development efforts and enhancing my workflow when crafting styles with Tailwind.

This project is a ReactJS Single Page Application [(SPA)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA) that utilizes components to render its different sections within the same page, utilizing state variables to control which components are displayed.

Throughout the development of this project, I gained significant knowledge of React's architecture, its management of the DOM, and its potential for facilitating the creation of web applications.
